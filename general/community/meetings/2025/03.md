## Agenda

Time-stamps show when in the recording each segment starts.

- 00:00 Moodle Products' growth spurt: find out how we are shaping up for the future at Moodle HQ - [Marie Achour](https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=4769294)
- 30:03 New question type restore API requirements - [Mark Johnson](https://moodle.org/user/profile.php?id=858318)

Note, there was some technical issue with the recording of the slides in Marie's part of the talk. That is a shame, but what she said is really interesting, and well worth listening to even without the slides.
