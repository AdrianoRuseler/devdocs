The Moodle Style Guide helps us create a clear and consistent approach to the content we produce: from our website, marketing, and communications to the actual text in Moodle products.

As an Australian company, we used Australian Standard English spelling and grammar conventions, unless otherwise indicated. Refer to the [Australian Government Style Manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/grammar-punctuation-and-conventions) for guidance.
