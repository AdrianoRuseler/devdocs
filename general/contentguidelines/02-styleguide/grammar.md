## Structuring content

### Headings

When writing headings:

- Start with the most relevant keywords where possible
- Be descriptive
- Avoid jargon or clever wordplay
- Use sentence case (sentence case is when the only capital letter is at the start of the heading)
- Don't put a full stop at the end

## Numbers

In general, use numerals instead of words for most numbers. Numerals are easier to scan, especially when users are skimming content.

Write out a number only when:

- It appears at the start of a sentence
- It could be confused for a letter (for example, the numeral '1' might look like an uppercase 'I')

### Number ranges

Always use the word 'to' to express a range of numbers, not a hyphen or dash, so that the sentence is read correctly by a screen reader.

<ValidExample title="Do">

5 to 11

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

5 - 11

</InvalidExample>

### Dates

We use the Australian sequence for dates, which is: day, month, year.

However, if you're writing for a specific audience, choose the date format that is most familiar to them.

#### Dates in sentences

When writing a date in a sentence, use DD Month YYYY. If a number has only one digit, don't include a leading zero.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3 November 2026

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

03 Nov 2026

</InvalidExample>

#### Numeric dates

When writing a date using only numbers, use DD/MM/YYYY. If a number has only one digit, don't include a leading zero.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3/5/2026

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

03/05/2026

</InvalidExample>

#### Ordinal numbers

Don't use ordinal numbers in dates.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3 November 2026

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

3rd November 2026

</InvalidExample>

#### Days of the week

If you include the day of the week in a date, add a comma after the day.

<ValidExample title="Do">

Friday, August 7

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

Friday August 7

</InvalidExample>

### Time and time zones​

In general, we use the Australian convention for time:

- Use 'am' for hours from midnight to noon
- Use 'pm' for hours from noon to midnight

However, choose the 12-hour or 24-hour format depending on what's most familiar to your audience.

#### Am and pm

Write 'am' and 'pm' always in lowercase, with a non-breaking space (&amp;nbsp) before them and with no full stops between the letters.

#### Minutes

For times on the hour, include minutes.

<ValidExample title="Do">

6:00 pm

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

6 pm

</InvalidExample>

#### Time zones

If you're writing about a specific time that affects people worldwide (for example, down time for a site or a deadline for a contest), always include the name of the time zone. You can also choose to include more than one time zone.

<ValidExample title="Do">

The contest will close at 4:00 pm AWST / 10:00 am CEST

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

The contest will close at 4:00 pm

</InvalidExample>

### Decimal points

To indicate decimal points, use full stops.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3.5

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

3,5

</InvalidExample>

Include a leading zero before the decimal point. This helps with readability and reduces ambiguity, especially for screen readers.

<ValidExample title="Do">

0.75

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

.75

</InvalidExample>

### Percentages

With numbers, use '%' instead of the word 'per cent'.

<ValidExample title="Do">

You have completed 89% of the course.

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

You have completed 89 per cent of the course.

</InvalidExample>

### Large numbers

Large numbers, such as millions, billions and trillions, are usually easier to read when they are written out as words. When writing out large numbers as words, don't use abbreviations.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3 million users

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

3M users

</InvalidExample>

If you use the numeric form, include a comma every three digits for readability.

<ValidExample title="Do">

3,000,000

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

3000000

</InvalidExample>

### Currencies and money

Put the currency symbol before the amount, not after it.

<ValidExample title="Do">

€300

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

300€

</InvalidExample>

Don't use full stops in currency abbreviations.

<ValidExample title="Do">

AUD

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

A.U.D

</InvalidExample>

### Measurement

Use metric as the default measurement system. Use a non-breaking space (&amp;nbsp) between the number and the unit.

<ValidExample title="Do">

15 km

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

15km

</InvalidExample>

## Moodle-specific punctuation and language

### Acronyms

Spell out acronyms when you first use them.

For example: *The advantages of Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) are...*

The exception is extremely common abbreviations where the abbreviated version is used more widely than the longer version, such as URL.

### Ampersands

Don't use an ampersand (&) to mean 'and', unless it's used in a brand name.

### Contractions

Use contractions for common phrases, such as 'don't' or 'can't'.

### Commas

Use the Oxford comma for the penultimate item in a sentence.

<ValidExample title="Do">

This includes user ID, role, and course ID.

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

This includes user ID, role and course ID.

</InvalidExample>

### Dashes and hyphens

Use an em dash (—) with spaces before and after to offset an aside.

<ValidExample title="Do">

The newest version of Moodle LMS — released last month — has had 200,000 downloads.

</ValidExample>

<InvalidExample title="Don't">

The newest version of Moodle LMS - released last month - has had 200,000 downloads.

</InvalidExample>

### Emails and URLs

Use lowercase for email addresses and website URLs. Don't include the 'https' part of the URL.

### Emojis

Use emojis sparingly. Don't use multiple emojis. Make sure you're confident in the emoji's meaning, and that it's consistent across cultures. You can check the meaning of emojis on [emojipedia.org](https://emojipedia.org).

### Exclamation marks

Save exclamation marks for key moments in the user journey, and don't use more than one exclamation mark.

### Sentence case

Use capital letters only at the beginning of sentences and for proper nouns. For headings, subheadings and calls to action, we use sentence case and not Title Case.
