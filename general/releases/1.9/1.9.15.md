Bug-fixing for general core bugs in 1.9.x has ended. Support continues for serious security issues, which is reflected in this release.

Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 1.9.15](http://moodle.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator!executeAdvanced.jspa?jqlQuery=project+%3D+mdl+and+resolution+%3D+fixed+AND+fixVersion+in+%28%221.9.15%22%29+ORDER+BY+priority+DESC&runQuery=true&clear=true).

## Security issues

- [MSA-11-0045](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=191751) - Potential to masquerade through MNet
- [MSA-11-0046](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=191752) - Insecure authentication transmission
- [MSA-11-0047](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=191754) - Possible injection attack in Calendar

PLEASE NOTE: The fix for MSA-11-0054 was mistakenly not included in the first November 28 build of 1.9.15 (Nov 28) but was included in the builds on December 2.  If you grabbed the build very early then you might not have that fix.
