Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 1.9.4](http://moodle.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10011&fixfor=10300&sorter/field=priority&sorter/order=DESC).

## Highlights

- [MDL-17205](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-17205) New options to allow Moodle to be configured to comply with European and US privacy regulations, like FERPA.
  - [MDL-17472](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-17472) New [Site policies](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Site_policies) setting for disabling [Notes](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Notes) completely
  - [MDL-17472](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-17472) New [Internal enrolment](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Internal_enrolment) settings for enforcing [enrolment key](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Enrolment_key) usage and complexity
  - [MDL-17222](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-17222) New [Security overview](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Security_overview) report
  - Separate capabilities for each report and other parts with sensitive information
- [Fix multiple bugs](http://moodle.atlassian.net/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?reset=true&pid=10011&query=categor*+-question&summary=true&description=true&resolution=1&fixfor=10300&assigneeSelect=specificuser&assignee=timhunt) relating to creating and editing course categories. Previously, giving admin permissions in a category and its subcategories did not work reliably. In the process, the separate create, update and delete category capabilities were replaced with [moodle/category:manage](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/moodle/category/manage), and moodle/category:visibility was renamed to [moodle/category:viewhiddencategories](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/moodle/category/viewhiddencategories).
- [MDL-8648](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-8648) Essay questions can now be randomised by random questions. This must be enabled under *Administration > Miscellaneous > Experimental*.
- [MDL-14926](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-14926) A new capability [mod/quiz:reviewmyattempts](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/mod/quiz/reviewmyattempts), separate from [mod/quiz:attempt](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/mod/quiz/attempt). This let's you create a read-only role that lets students see what they have done on a course in the past, without being able to change anything any more.
- [MDL-16651](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-16651) A new capability [mod/scorm:deleteresponses](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/mod/scorm/deleteresponses) allowing deletion of SCORM attempts
- [MDL-6160](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-6160) Email notification of [course requests](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_request), and a new capability [moodle/course:request](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/moodle/course/request) to control who can request courses.
- [MDL-17364](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-17364) New [Forum setting](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Forum_settings) for enabling [AJAX forum ratings](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Forum_ratings)
- [MDL-10021](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-10021) New option, "Yes, without frame", for the [file resource](https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_or_website_link) "Keep page navigation visible on the same page" setting. This option displays a resource in a XHTML strict page. Other options have been kept.
- [MDL-16999](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-16999) Some [database module settings](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Adding/editing_a_database) have been fixed ('Required Entries' and ' Required Entries before viewing). If the fix has an impact on your Moodle installation, you will be warned during upgrade.
