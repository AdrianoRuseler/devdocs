## Before you upgrade

### Questions engine upgrade

When upgrading to Moodle 2.1 or 2.2 it was possible to [delay part of the Question engine upgrade](https://docs.moodle.org/21/en/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.1#Planning_the_question_engine_upgrade). You must complete this upgrade before upgrading to Moodle 2.7. You can check if this was completed at the bottom of the [Environment page](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Environment).

For further information, see the upgrading notes to [complete the Question engine upgrade before Moodle 2.7](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Upgrading#Questions_engine_upgrade).

### Themes

All standard themes present in earlier versions, except **Clean**, have been removed from Moodle 2.7.  If you wish to continue using one of these themes then you will need to reinstall it explicitly before running the upgrade.

See the upgrading notes for [theme upgrades in Moodle 2.7](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Upgrading#Themes) for further information.

## Headline features

### Interface

- [MDL-42964](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-42964) - [Themes clean-up](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Standard_themes) - Moodle is focussed on Bootstrap and improved responsive design.  Clean is now the default theme and most other old themes have been removed from core (still available from Plugins directory).  Many small improvements have been made all through the interface.
- [MDL-43786](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43786) - More theme - A completely new theme called More that provides easy configuration though the UI, while retaining the efficiency of LESS and the responsiveness of Bootstrap.
- [MDL-43841](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43841) - New [text editor](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Text_editor), Atto - Tightly integrated in Moodle and focussing on usability and accessibility (TinyMCE still available as an option).
- [MDL-44070](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-44070) - Improved [conditional activities](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Conditional_activities_settings) - Complex boolean combinations are now supported to control when activities are available to students, with a conditions plugin API and a better interface...and it's faster!
- [MDL-43855](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43855) - New mathematical equation editor for Atto, producing TeX using a GUI without needing Java.  Works everywhere, even tablets and phones.
- [MDL-43856](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43856) - New [MathJax filter](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/MathJax_filter) for displaying mathematical equations without needing binaries on the server.
- [MDL-44637](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-44637) - New report listing all events possible on a site.

### Platform

- [MDL-37658](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-37658) - Logging - a new logging subsystem with plugins allowing Moodle logs to be very detailed and external. Log reports have been updated too.  [Many new events](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Events_list) have been added which developers can take advantage of. These advancements will support better analytics in future as well as reporting standards like TinCan.
- [MDL-25499](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-25499) - Scheduled Tasks - an improved [scheduling system](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Scheduled_tasks) (like Unix cron) that allows precise scheduling of tasks even on complex clustered servers.
- Performance - With improvements to logging and scheduled tasks, as well as many other small improvements, overall performance will be improved, particularly on large sites.

### Long-term support (LTS) until May 2017

This release will have an extra-long period of support from Moodle HQ for **3 years** (instead of the usual 1.5 years).

If you have been stuck on an old version like Moodle 1.9 then this might be the perfect time to join us in the future!

### Assignment

- [MDL-33952](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33952) - The old Assignment (2.2) module has been removed from core. It has been replaced by a stub to support transparently remapping urls and restoring course backups from the old module to the new one. If you are still using the old assignment module - all instances of the old assignment module will be hidden after upgrading to Moodle 2.7. Once the upgrade tool is run on those assignments they will become visible again. It is recommended to upgrade, and then convert any remaining assignments because logic has been added to the assignment upgrade code for Moodle 2.7 to transparently map urls from the old assignment module to the new one. If you really, really need to keep using the old module, you should update the code to Moodle 2.7, and then replace the "mod/assignment" folder with the one from https://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-mod_assignment/releases before completing the upgrade.
- [MDL-28448](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-28448) - A new capability [mod/assign:editothersubmission](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Capabilities/mod/assign:editothersubmission) can be given to teachers to allow them to edit or delete student submissions.

- [MDL-42585](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-42585) - New capability [mod/assign:viewgrades](https://docs.moodle.org/27/en/Capabilities/mod/assign:viewgrades) to allow grades to be viewed but not changed

- [MDL-44505](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-44505) - Subject line of forum notifications can now be configured through language string customisation

### SCORM

- [MDL-43011](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43011) - SCORM new window now opens without headers/footers as expected.

### Cron

- [MDL-25499](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-25499) - Cron has received a major update and now has support for both scheduled and adhoc tasks.
The benefits of these changes are:
- The schedule for every task can be configured by the admin
- Tasks can run in parallel
- Cron processes use locking to prevent the same task running at the same time by different processes

A result of this is that cron can be run much more often, which means (for example) forum posts can be sent out sooner. It is now strongly recommended that administrators increase the frequency that cron is run to at least *once per minute*, however it can be kept at it's previous schedule if desired if you do not wish to benefit from these changes.

### Badges

## Developer Notes

- Logging and events: All plugins should convert their logging and triggering of events to the new API. See [Migrating logging calls in plugins](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Migrating_logging_calls_in_plugins).
- Reports: Reports that use log table should be updated to use the new logging framework. Old reports will continue to work as before as long as legacy logging is enabled in the site. See [Migrating log access in reports](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Migrating_log_access_in_reports) for details.
- Developers can now use the [Lock API](/docs/apis/core/lock/) to lock critical tasks (even across cluster nodes).
- Plugins can now use the [Task API](/docs/apis/subsystems/task/) to schedule background tasks and developers are encouraged to convert to this API from legacy cron.
- New plugin type for conditional availability. See [Availability conditions](/docs/apis/plugintypes/availability/).
- New plugin type for Atto editor. See [Atto](/docs/apis/plugintypes/atto/)
- New plugin type for Logging store.

### API changes

- [MDL-39952](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-39952) - Core events: All core events have been converted to the new [Events API](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Events_API). The list of all events is available for admin in report "Events list". Writing observers to the new events is easier but old-style observers will continue to work. Moodle plans to add missing validation to core events before release of 2.7.1 (it will not affect plugins unless they directly trigger core events).
- [MDL-43040](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-43040) - Activity modules should use $plugin instead of $module in mod/*/version.php.
- [MDL-45250](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-45250) - add_to_log() has been deprecated and now generates debugging warnings\
