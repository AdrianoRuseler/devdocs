### Security improvements

The following bug fixes or improvements were made, which contribute to improving security or privacy best practices:

- [MDL-65779](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-65779) - Forum backup and restore now retains any private replies as private
- [MDL-60347](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-60347) - SMTP debugging now also requires developer level debugging messages to be enabled before being displayed.
