Release date: 3 December 2012

Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 2.4](https://moodle.atlassian.net/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20mdl%20AND%20resolution%20%3D%20fixed%20AND%20fixVersion%20in%20(%222.4%22)%20ORDER%20BY%20priority%20DESC).

Many thanks to [everyone that worked on the new features in this release](http://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php?version=2.4.x)

A special thanks to our incredible **Integration Team** from Moodle HQ who worked tirelessly with all developers to review, test and help finish code for inclusion in Moodle core:

- Eloy Lafuente
- Sam Hemelryk
- Dan Poltawski
- Aparup Bannerjee

Finally, thanks to all our testers both within Moodle HQ and from the whole community, who have contributed to producing our most exciting and stable release yet!

### Requirements

- Recommended minimum browser: Firefox 4, Internet Explorer 8  (IE 10 required for drag and drop of files from outside the browser into Moodle), Safari 5, Google Chrome 11
- Moodle upgrade:  Moodle 2.2 or later (if upgrading from earlier versions, you must upgrade to 2.2 as a first step)
- Minimum DB versions: PostgreSQL 8.3, MySQL 5.1.33 ([MDL-33984](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33984)), MSSQL 2005 or Oracle 10.2
- Minimum PHP version: PHP 5.3.2

NOTE: We will drop support for IE8 after Moodle 2.5 (June 2013).  This means IE8 will probably still work for 2.6, but developers will not be required to test their new code on that browser.  Moodle, like most of the world's web sites and browser producers, encourages you to keep your browsers current to improve security and functionality while saving us valuable time.  ([For example see what Google is doing](http://googleappsupdates.blogspot.ca/2012/09/supporting-modern-browsers-internet.html))

### Major new features

#### Performance improvements

A variety of improvements have been made under the hood to improve performance in a number of ways.  Some require configuration by the admin to take advantage of them but used properly they can allow you to make better use of your hardware for faster speed and more students.

- [MDL-33018](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33018) - New context index to substantially improve system performance on large PostgreSQL installations.
- [MDL-30643](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-30643) - Improved daily statistics performance.
- [MDL-33017](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33017) - Significant size reduction of navigation widget.
- [MDL-25290](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-25290) - MUC Stage 1: Implement some core caching architecture (MUC).
- [MDL-34343](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34343) - Database meta information caching.
- [MDL-34399](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34399) - Question related caching.
- [MDL-36211](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-36211) - Performance improvement by not locking guests and not-logged-in users sessions

These results show out-of-the-box improvements without tuning or adding special MUC-supported backends (which would improve things even more).

- [Other tests](http://www.iteachwithmoodle.com/2012/11/17/moodle-2-4-beta-performance-test-comparison-with-moodle-2-3/) have even better results

#### Plugin updating from within Moodle

- [MDL-35238](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-35238) - Not only will Moodle tell you when one of your plugins is out-of-date, but you can also now [update it via the web interface](https://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Installing_plugins).

#### Course format plugins

Moodle has always supported pluggable course formats, but now we've given developers even more flexibility than before.  Course formats can now provide their own settings for courses and sections, and they can also have a lot more control of all the pages in a course.

- [MDL-35218](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-35218) - [Course formats re-factoring](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Course_formats_2)

We're looking forward to seeing some exciting course formats from the community in future.    (Note that in 2.4 the standard course formats have not been changed).

#### Icons

The default icons used for activities and editing actions have been updated for the first time since Moodle 1.0.  Not only are they a little bigger and more colourful but they are SVG format and support full scaling on all devices, so they always look good.  (Developers, see [Moodle icons 2.4](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Moodle_icons_2.4))

- [MDL-22955](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-22955) - Support for SVG icons.

#### Themes

- [MDL-34299](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34299) - All pages are now served with HTML5 doctype by default. This allows us to improve usability, add new features, developers can use reliable iframe tag instead of broken object embedding, data attributes may simplify JavaScript code, etc.
- [MDL-36487](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-36487), [MDL-36481](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-36481) - Improved compatibility with Internet Explorer 8-10.
- [MDL-34915](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34915) - SimpleYUI enables similar coding style to JQuery, it is intended especially for theme designers.
- Multiple RTL fixes and improvements.
- [MDL-36544](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-36544) - Remove special border-radius on course/site description block, standard theme
- [MDL-34257](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34257), [MDL-31365](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-31365) - New 'secure' page layout type, for use with [the quiz's 'Full screen pop-up with some JavaScript security' setting](https://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Quiz_settings#Extra_restrictions_on_attempts). If you don't update your theme, it seems you might get problems: [](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=218074)

#### Improved TinyMCE editor integration

The integration of TinyMCE  editor was significantly improved:

- [MDL-33041](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-33041) - Support for fully configurable add-on plugins extending standard TinyMCE.
- [MDL-35172](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-35172) - New TinyMCE editor settings allowing an admin to [customise the toolbar](https://docs.moodle.org/24/en/Text_editor), enable/disable icons such as insert equation and insert emoticon.

- [MDL-34875](https://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL-34875) - Other minor fixes and improvements.
