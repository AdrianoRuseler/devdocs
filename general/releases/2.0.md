## Moodle 2.0

Release date: 24th November 2010

Moodle 2.0 contains a lot of large new features, some completely rewritten features, and hundreds of bug fixes.  For full details (more than you probably want!), see [the full list of fixed issues in 2.0](http://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL/fixforversion/10122).

### Major new features

#### [Community hubs](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Community_hub)

- Anybody can set up a Community hub, which is a directory of courses for public use or for private communities.  The code is implemented as separate GPL plugin for Moodle.
- Sites can register to any Community hub (instead of just moodle.org)
- Teachers on registered sites can publish their full courses to Community hubs, for download
- Teachers on registered sites can also advertise their courses on Community hubs, for people to join
- Teachers on any site can search all public Community hubs and download courses as templates for their own courses
- Users on any Moodle site can also search Community hubs for courses (and communities of practice) to participate in.  Initially we are encouraging **'communities of teaching practice**' but any sort of course can be listed.

#### [Repository support](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Repositories)

- File management has undergone a major change in both the interface and function.
- The [File picker](https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_picker) presents a standard way to access the new [File bank](https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_bank) repository system.
- This allows Moodle to integrate with external repositories of content, making it really simple to bring documents and media into Moodle via an AJAX interface that looks like a standard **Open** dialogue in desktop applications.
- Initial plugins in 2.0 include: Alfresco, Amazon S3, Box.net, File system on Server, Flickr, Google Docs, MERLOT, Picasa, Recent Files, WebDAV servers, Wikimedia, Youtube.  These are simple to develop, so many more are expected.
- You can also import files from your desktop or by specifying a URL.
- There are more attributes that can be added to a file, such as license and author.

#### [Portfolio support](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Portfolios)

- Modules can now export their data to external systems, particularly useful for portfolios where snapshots of forums, assignments and other things in Moodle are useful to record in a journal or a portfolio of evidence
- Different formats are supported (currently LEAP2A, HTML, Images and Text, but others like PDF can be added)
- Initial plugins in 2.0 include: Box.net, Flickr, Google Docs, **Mahara** and Picasa.

#### [Course completion](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Course_completion) and prerequisites

- Teachers can now specify a [Course completion](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Course_completion) condition standard for all students.  Conditions include activity completion, but could also be by grade, date or a number of other criteria.
- Teachers can use the above standard as a [prerequisite](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_completion_tracking) to other courses that allows ordered progression and scaffolding.
- Teachers and students can see reports that show the progress within a course, or through a series of courses.

#### [Conditional activities](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Conditional_activities)

- Access to activities can be restricted based on certain criteria, such as dates, grade obtained, or the completion of another activity.
- These can be chained together to enable progressive disclosure of the course content, if that is desired.
- Teachers can now specify conditions that define when any **activity** is seen as [completed](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Activity_completion) by a student.  For example, when a certain number of posts have been made, or a grade has been reached, or a choice has been made.

#### Cohorts

- Also known as "Site-wide groups", these are site-wide collections of users that can be enrolled into courses in one action, either manually or synchronised automatically

#### [Web services support](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Web_Services)

- Support for standards-based web services across the entire Moodle code base, allowing the admin to expose particular functions of Moodle for use by:
  - Administrative systems such as HR or SIS applications
  - Mobile clients
- Framework contains a very high-level of security with a detailed token system and complete control over the range of functions exposed
- All defined functions are automatically available via:
  - XML-RPC
  - AMF (Flash)
  - REST
  - SOAP (PHP)

#### New blocks

- [Comments block](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Comments_block) - like a shoutbox, allows comments to be added to any page. Great for student feedback.
- [My private files block](https://docs.moodle.org/en/My_private_files_block) - allows access to a user's private files, which can then be accessed by them anywhere with the [File picker](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/File_picker). There is quota management available.
- [Community block](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Community_block) - keeps track of external courses one is interested in
- [Course completion status block](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Course_completion_status_block) - reports on the completion status of your courses

#### [Plagiarism prevention](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Plagiarism_Prevention)

- Moodle supports integration with plagiarism prevention tools such as Turnitin

### Major improvements to existing core features

#### [Backup and restore](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Backup_2.0)

- Completely rewritten Backup/Restore framework, no longer bound by memory (can work with **any size course**).
- Completely new backup format.
- Improved interface.
- Backup can be made of whole courses, but also specific sections or activities.

#### [Blocks](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Blocks_2.0)

- Blocks are now consistently implemented on every page in Moodle
- No longer any limit to placing blocks in only the left and right column regions but also at the top, center or bottom of areas of pages)
- Any block can be [forced to appear](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Sticky_blocks) in all the page [contexts](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Context) below it (for example, in every course or throughout a course).
- Blocks can  placed in the [Dock](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Dock) area on the side of the screen (if the theme supports it)

#### [Blogs](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Blogs_2.0)

- Support for comments on each blog entry
- Removal of group-level and course-level blogs (these are converted into forums on upgrade)
- Support for external blog feeds (synchronised to Moodle blog)

#### [Comments](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Comments_2.0)

- Support for multiple forms of enrolment at the same time
- More detailed control over enrolment in courses

#### [File handling](https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_handling_2.0)

- There is a new [File picker](https://docs.moodle.org/en/File_picker) interface that manages files for resources and when they are used in an activity, such as including an image in a content page.
- Full support for Unicode file names on all operating systems.
- Metadata about each file (author, date, license, etc) and what the file is used for are stored in the database.
- Duplicate files (for example, a large video file use in two different courses) are only stored once, saving disk space.
- Security has been improved because files have the same contexual permissions as the activity that uses them. (For example, a file may belong to a file resource, a forum post or a wiki page ). Files are no longer just "uploaded to the course".

#### [Filters 2.0](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Filters_2.0)

- In the past, you had to use the same filters everywhere in your Moodle site, and this could only be changed by admins.
- Now, you can have different filters in different courses, activities or categories.
- For example, you could turn on the LaTeX filter just for courses in the Maths and Physics categories.
- Or you could turn off glossary linking in the end of course exam.

### System requirements

Since Moodle 2.0 is such a major release, we are allowing ourselves some increases in the requirements.

- PHP must be 5.2.8 or later (it was released 08-Dec-2008), PHP 5.3.3 or later is recommended
- Databases should be one of the following:
  - MySQL 5.0.25 or later  (InnoDB storage engine highly recommended)
  - PostgreSQL 8.3 or later
  - Oracle 10.2 or later
  - MS SQL 2005 or later
- Any standards-supporting browser from the past few years, for example:
  - Firefox 3 or later
  - Safari 3 or later
  - Google Chrome 4 or later
  - Opera 9 or later
  - MS Internet Explorer 7 or later (Even [Google doesn't support IE6 any more](http://googleenterprise.blogspot.com/2010/01/modern-browsers-for-modern-applications.html))
  - etc

### Upgrading

When upgrading to Moodle 2.0, you must have Moodle 1.9 or later.  if you are using an earlier version of Moodle (eg 1.8.x) then you need to upgrade to Moodle 1.9.x first. We advise that you test the upgrade first on a COPY of your production site, to make sure it works as you expect.

For further information, see [Upgrading to Moodle 2.0](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Upgrading_to_Moodle_2.0).

### For developers: API changes

See [Migrating contrib code to 2.0](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Migrating_contrib_code_to_2.0)

- [Plugin system changes in Moodle 2.0](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Plugin_system_changes_in_Moodle_2.0) - all the different types of plugin are now handles more consistently when it comes to installation and upgrading, capabilities, events, and so on.
