Release date: 25th November 2009

**Important**:  Upgrading is very highly recommended!

Here is [the full list of fixed issues in 1.8.11](http://moodle.atlassian.net/browse/MDL/fixforversion/10383).

## Functional changes

- After upgrading, admins will be asked to change their passwords next time they log in (manual or email based self-registration accounts only).
- To reduce the risk of password theft, a [password salt](https://docs.moodle.org/en/Password_salting) is set in *config.php* in new installs and for upgrades, admins are sent an email recommending that they do so.
- Teachers lose permission to include ANY user data in a course backup or restore a course including user data due to new capabilities  [moodle/backup:userinfo](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/moodle/backup/userinfo) and [moodle/restore:userinfo](https://docs.moodle.org/Capabilities/moodle/restore/userinfo) which are not set for the default role of teacher.  Sites with custom roles should check permissions carefully.
- Hashed user passwords are no longer saved in backup files containing user data. If a backup is restored to a new site, users will be asked to go through the "forgot my password" routine the first time they log in.
- In Moodle 1.8.11+ weekly from 23/12/09 onwards: Moodle will no longer serve any uploaded Flash files to browsers with old Flash plugins. Admins can set the minimum required Flash player version in *Site Administration > Security > HTTP Security*.
